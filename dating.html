<p class="description-paras">Hi! I'm <b>Bartek, 22</b> and the internet mostly knows me as <b>PokerFacowaty</b>. I'm generally looking for a stable relationship, more on the specifics a bit later.
<p class="description-paras">I <b>work</b> as a Content Reviewer at A Generic Corporation with Bad Management That Pretty Much Annoys Me Anytime Someone There Makes a Decision...&trade;.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I <b>studied</b> Swedish Language and Culture at Jagiellonian University for 2 years before eventually dropping out (partly because of remote learning and my lack of motivation coming with it) and have currently no plans to study anything, but probably will pick something up at some point. I'm just not a person who can memorize a phone book because someone told me to - sorry not sorry - and would need to really be into a subject in order to study it, especially when working full time. On the bright side, the two years were not completely lost, I still remember some <b>Svenska</b> and would like to get back to feeling comfortable speaking it again.</p>
<p class="description-paras">My <b>biggest passion</b> is definitely speedrunning (finishing games as fast as possible) and organising charity speedrunning events. I am a CEO of a Foundation - GSPS - and over 5 years we've raised over 140k PLN during a number of events that gathered community members from the entire country and beyond. GSPS is definitely a project that has a special place in my heart. Other than that, I also help organize other events, such as ESA in Sweden.</p>

<p class="description-paras"><b>My other interests</b> involve old technology (such as my VHS cam that I ocassionally vlog with, casettes, vinyl, old games and consoles, I have a TV that's the size of a small house), </p>
<p class="description-paras"><b>Recently I'm into</b> getting a bit more tech-savy, which mostly comes down to learning basic Python and trying to feel more comfortable with Linux. Pretty much every step I make is very rewarding and I get very excited when a program does what I want it to do, even if sometimes my 17-years-of-IT-experience-I-wrote-assembly-in-kindergarten friends don't fully understand it. Front-end is not yet my strong side (as you can see, lol), but I'm fairly happy with this site I made from scratch.</p>
<p class="description-paras">In terms of <b>personality</b> I am an introvert, but it might not be very obvious when I'm around people I feel comfortable with. My introvert side is more manifested when I need a day spent in my room without talking to anyone after a week-long event or feeling happy just staying home and doing nothing.</p>
<p class="description-paras">When asking about <b>music</b>, nobody likes hearing "oh I just listen to everything"  so I'll at least <i>try</i> to elaborate a bit more. My music involves a spectrum of genres from metal to Ekwador Manieczki Urodziny Brutka 01.02.2003 r. I rarely use Spotify, so whenever I finally make a system for showing my library and playlists on this site, the link will be here (not yet). Examples would include pretty much all of the soundtrack for GTA, Tony Hawk and Need for Speed games, Rock classics (like Asia, Dire Straits), 80's Pop, stuff that I considered cringy at 16 years old that actually slaps (like early 2010's Rihanna or Black Eyed Peas), old Polish Rap (≈Åona, Grammatik, Smarki). At one point I digged into dream house (which led me to discover the beauty that is <a id="sirens" href="https://youtu.be/p_TkwNLJn68" target="_blank"><b>Sirens of the Sea</b></a> for example) and similar genres. This led me also like and seek "harder", more rhytmic electronic music like <a id="twice" href="https://youtu.be/R2hlXiwe4Aw" target="_blank"><b>Twice in a Blue Moon</b></a>. Recently, I'm slowly going through all Lana Del Rey's albums and holy shit how the hell can everything on Born to Die be so good?  </p>

<p class="description-paras">Because of my interest in closed torrenting communities sparked by the first wave of we-know-what, I've sort of become the Red from Shawshank Redemption to my friends.</p>
