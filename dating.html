<p class="description-paras">Hi! I'm <span class="highlights">Bartek, 22</span> and the internet mostly knows me as <span class="highlights">PokerFacowaty</span>. I'm generally looking for a stable relationship, more on the specifics a bit later. I've highlighted the topics of the paragraphs below, hopefully that makes this wall of text a bit more bearable.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">work</span> as a Content Reviewer at A Generic Corporation with Bad Management That Pretty Much Annoys Me Anytime Someone There Makes a Decision...&trade;.</p>
<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">studied</span> Swedish Language and Culture at Jagiellonian University for 2 years before eventually dropping out (partly because of remote learning and my lack of motivation coming with it) and have currently no plans to study anything, but probably will pick something up at some point. I'm just not a person who can memorize a phone book because someone told me to - sorry not sorry - and would need to really be into a subject in order to study it, especially when working full time. On the bright side, the two years were not completely lost, I still remember some <span class="highlights">Svenska</span> and would like to get back to feeling comfortable speaking it again.</p>

<p class="description-paras">My <span class="highlights">biggest passion</span> is definitely speedrunning (finishing games as fast as possible) and organising charity speedrunning events. I am a CEO of a Foundation - GSPS - and over 5 years we've raised over 140k PLN during a number of events that gathered community members from the entire country and beyond. GSPS is definitely a project that has a special place in my heart. Other than that, I also help organize other events, such as ESA in Sweden.</p>
<p class="description-paras"><span class="highlights">My other interests</span> involve old technology (like my VHS cam that I ocassionally vlog with, casettes, vinyl, old games and consoles, I also have a TV that's the size of a small house), skating and patiently watching crypto collapse.</p>
<p class="description-paras"><span class="highlights">Recently I'm also into</span> getting a bit more tech-savy, which mostly comes down to learning basic Python and trying to feel more comfortable with Linux. Pretty much every step I make is very rewarding and I get very excited when a program does what I want it to do, even if sometimes my 17-years-of-IT-experience-I-wrote-assembly-in-kindergarten friends don't fully understand it. Front-end is not yet my strong side (as you can see, lol), but I'm fairly happy with this site I made from scratch.</p>
<p class="description-paras">Because of my <span class="highlights">interest</span> in closed torrenting communities sparked by the first wave of we-know-what, I've sort of become the Red from Shawshank Redemption to my friends. Hit me up if you need me to download you a rock hammer, officer.</p>

<p class="description-paras">In terms of <span class="highlights">personality</span> I am an introvert, but it might not be very obvious when I'm around people I feel comfortable with. My introvert side is more manifested when I need a day spent in my room without talking to anyone after a week-long event or feeling happy just staying home and doing nothing. I would say I am not a person to go clubbing with, but actually I would like to find a place that'd convince me there are clubs differing from the mainstream picture of music so loud you can't hear shit and cocaine in the bathroom. If you know any, it could be a date. As long as you're comfortable with the possibility of leaving early.</p>

<p class="description-paras">I <span class="highlights">value</span> (random order) being fair and sticking to the rules. I'm not a saint, but I want to try and be fair whenever possible, even though that's sometimes seen as me being naive and not knowing the rules of the "real life". I disagree with people a lot over this and it is a hot take, but I have a feeling Eastern European upbringing makes you think cheating your way up to the top is smart and I hate that. All of this sounds a bit extreme reading it back, so to counter it a bit - I cheat at times, obviously. I've cheated in quizzes at uni during covid because it was possible and I couldn't resist. The thing that really pisses me off is dumb cheating. Real-life example: at work I have to work for 5 hours a day, during which I can easily take a couple short break that are still counted as work and nobody has ever minded. Meanwhile, people try to take hour-long breaks during that time and think nobody will realize and when they inevitably do, everybody gets punished. Screw that. As far as honesty goes, I really want to be open in communication instead of playing mind games, especially with someone I share my life with. Whether I said something mean without realizing or the sex the day before was horrible, I'd rather know all about it and want to know I can bring up issues I have like this as well. Politics-wise, I'm leaning left, but hate places like Leftbook focused on wars between leftists and leftists with deep passion. I <i>tend</i> to try and see systemic issues and see poor people as victims rather than people at fault, I guess you could say I'm at least trying to be compassionate. I can generally say I'm alright with people having different opinions than mine, we can disagree and still be friends, unless the ""opinions"" come with a strong taste of misogyny, contempt or xenophobia, because if they do, then fuck you and your "no more mr nice guy", he was never there. Stability is something that's very crucial to me. I like routines, knowing what I will be doing the next day. Half my life I've been told by random media that it's boring and terrible and only now discovering that this is what I enjoy a lot and it's totally fine for me to do so.</p>

<p class="description-paras">When asking about <span class="highlights">music</span>, nobody likes hearing "oh I just listen to everything"  so I'll at least <i>try</i> to elaborate a bit more. My music involves a spectrum of genres from metal to Ekwador Manieczki Urodziny Brutka 01.02.2003 r. I rarely use Spotify, so whenever I finally make a system for showing my library and playlists on this site, the link will be here (not yet). Examples would include pretty much all of the soundtrack for GTA, Tony Hawk and Need for Speed games, Rock classics (like Asia, Dire Straits), 80's Pop, stuff that I considered cringy at 16 years old that actually slaps (like early 2010's Rihanna or Black Eyed Peas), old Polish Rap (Łona, Grammatik, Smarki). At one point I digged into dream house (which led me to discover the beauty that is <a id="sirens" href="https://youtu.be/p_TkwNLJn68" target="_blank">Sirens of the Sea</a> for example) and similar genres. This led me also like and seek "harder", more rhytmic electronic music like <a id="twice" href="https://youtu.be/R2hlXiwe4Aw" target="_blank">Twice in a Blue Moon</a>. Recently, I'm slowly going through all Lana Del Rey's albums and holy shit how the hell can everything on Born to Die be so good?</p>

<p id="dates-header">Date ideas:</p>
<div class="dates">
<ul>
    <li>Watching Dirty Dancing together (but it has to be at your place, my TV is placed where two walls meet and nobody puts Baby in the corner)</li>
    <li>Cooking something together at my place (the kitchen is so tiny it'll almost be like cuddling)</li>
    <li>Taking a walk in a place not crowded enough for it to be an issue but also not empty so we're both safe on April the 25th, because it's not too hot and not too cold. All you need is a light jacket.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="description-paras">If you haven't figured out by now, I have a special <span class="highlights">sense of humour</span>, I love jokes that are generally considered awful, especially when they involve translating something word-by-word to make monsters (like "take yourself behind state that" being "weź się zastanów") or wordpuns like <a id="jaronski" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363066376124104706/973708025330294815/unknown.png" target="_blank">this one</a>. <a id="punhub" href="https://twitter.com/PunHubOnline" target="_blank">PunHub</a> is one of the best Twitter accounts in existence.</p>
<p class="description-paras">When it comes to <span class="highlights">preferences</span>, I would like to meet a person that mostly shares my values and accepts me with my little quirks and hobbies and such. In terms of looks, I'm open to pretty much all body types, but I need to admit, if you're a large woman, I am largely interested.</p>

<p class="description-paras">On a similar note - my <span class="highlights">sexuality / gender identity</span> (and I'm sorry in advance if I'm being too honest about this, but I would love for this part to be clear) - I am a dude that's mostly straight. I'm attracted to cis women, trans women, generally feminine people. My only issue is I don't know if penises are a hard nope as I haven't tried yet, but I'm not instatly turned off by them. So far I've tried to avoid dating people with penises despite my attraction so that I don't have to hurt anyone by suddenly realising there's a part of them that's a turnoff and I've recently been told that maybe I should try, so do with that information what you will. Also, I'm a total switch.</p>
<p class="description-paras">If you survived through all this, I'm flattered, thank you :)</p>
