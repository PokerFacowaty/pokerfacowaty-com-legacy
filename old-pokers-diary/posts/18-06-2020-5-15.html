I've made a couple changes to this site. From now on, there's actually an <link><a href="../archive"><b>ARCHIVE</b></a></link><br> here.
It contains stuff I either need or find useful for other people ;)<br><br>
Another change I've made is to the <link><a href="../my-stuff-i-like/my-stuff-i-like.html"><b>MY STUFF I LIKE</b></a></link> page.
Aside from cosmetic stuff, I've added some recent runs, a whole section for runs that actually were trainwrecks and another one
for the marathons I participated in in any way.<br><br>
I also wiped everything on the <link><a href="../goals/goals.html"><b>GOALS</b></a></link> page since it was outdated. Enjoy.
