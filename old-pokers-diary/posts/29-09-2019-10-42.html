<p id="textbox">So yesterday we went to MAX and it tasted just like in Sweden.
Totally worth the hour of driving. Apparently, their restaurants are only in Sweden, 
Denmark, Norway, Egypt and Poland. No idea who brought it here, but that man is a hero.

<p id="textbox">Before that, we'd also been to the electronics market and it seems like it's almost dead
these days. You can still find pirated X360 games, cheap porn DVDs and some chinese
electronics there, but you can almost smell this place's agony. It surely has seen better days.
Bought a sealed polish Singstar R&B for PS2 nonetheless (knew about polish 80's and a couple
others, but didn't know this one was a thing), so in the end it was kinda worth it.

Also Kaadzik found a cheap PS2 in Cracow in the evening and I went to get it. Like $3,50 for a
fully working SCPH-70003, public transportation included :P
