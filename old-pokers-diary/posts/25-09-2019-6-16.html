<p id="textbox">First of all, I showed off my recently bought fat PS3 to friends
on Discord today. Had got it with some other consoles as a set. Turned out to not be
best deal of my life, but that's not the point here. It turned out it's
a bit faulty and as a result, it starts up and after a minute the fans are
already spinning at their max speed. After a couple seconds the console turns itself off.
Dexterw made a fantastic meme about it, go and check it out

As for gaming related stuff, I started playing Guren Street pretty late tonight. 
Advanced to a 1:26 fairly quickly and started streaming after about half an hour of playing. 
Played for about 2,5h total and finished with a 1:25 after getting 11 1:26s. 2 more seconds
to go then and I'm feeling a lot more confident with the horrible camera changes already.
Looking forward to grinding some more soon. <br><br>

<p id="textbox"><br>During the stream, I had the idea of taking my rollerblades down to the river to test my 
family's Sony Hi8 cam I stole from home on a nice sunrise. That's the reason I wanted to either 
get a 1:25 quickly or call it a day on a 1:26. I turned my stream off and opened the window to
check the weather right afterwards and it was raining cats and dogs. As much as I like rain,
poor fella had a bad timing tonight. It's already light and it's still drizzling a bit. I might
just try again tomorrow. For now, I'm going to take and shower and head to bed. See to you soon.</p>
