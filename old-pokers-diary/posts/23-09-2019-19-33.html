<p id="textbox">Alright, time to add something before this page goes live. The last thing I've done was the first
recording of my Master Save in San Andreas. Hopefully recording it, keeping track of it here and not caring
about some of the stuff required to have a REAL TRUE UNIQUE MASTER SAVE will allow me to finish it this time.
Ditching the "no deaths" rule amongst others was a really good decision, because I died when grinding lung capacity
with over 70% on the skill out of not paying attention to the game for a couple seconds. <br><br> Also meeting 
this fella was quite a highlight.
