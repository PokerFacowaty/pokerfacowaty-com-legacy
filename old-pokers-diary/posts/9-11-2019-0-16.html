Got a PB in Gothic All Chapters yesterday (the day before actually, but it's barely after midnight, K?) 
by about a second and since I'm still yet to substract the ~30s of loads not seen by the load remover, I don't
even know if that's actually a PB. I might just ignore it and keep going for a 1:29 with having skipped it.</br></br>
Today (again, yesterday to be precise), we went to MAX again, this time with 2 other
Swedish students and Kaadzik. The whole idea was born just a couple of days ago, just as I like.
Then, me and Dorota had a pretty long trip to IKEA mostly to try out their Kanelbullar and kill some time (we also managed
something that was supposed ton be Glogg! (Swedish letters screw up the font for some reason). 
It was purely awesome and I even managed to get some
footage of it on my Hi8 cam. I need to use it more since I absolutely love the way it feels
to shoot with it, as well as the overall VHS-like look of the footage. 
Check it out <link><a href="https://youtu.be/oQNywJwvERo"><b>HERE.</b></a></link>
(It's in Polish, though, oops.)<br><br>
