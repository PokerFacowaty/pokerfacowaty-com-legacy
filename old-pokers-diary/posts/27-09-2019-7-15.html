<p id="textbox">I woke up at 7 PM, hence Mary and dexter were already ahead of me
when it comes to stats in Free OS. We had enough money to buy a lot and build a house.
Long after we'd bought a lot of furniture I was told to buy in special lots rather
than in the in-game Buy Mode since it's expensive as hell. Good stuff. We made some
more money, boosted some more stats, the usual. As I said, besides making money
in some ways that require you to actually be active, this game seems perfect for 
leaving it on, checking in every now and then and grinding ILs.

I won an auction with a set of consoles today. Full PS1 set with a controller, 3 Slim
PS2s, 2 Wii Balance Boards, a PS3 Slim with a DS3 and a bunch of cables and controllers,
all untested for like $55. Looking into selling most of it, will probably keep the PS3
Slim to myself, as I still think it's one of the most beautiful consoles out there,
despite PS3s not really being my thing.

Also, I went skating to see the sunrise today. Here's a pic of Vistula near my new home. 
Good night!
