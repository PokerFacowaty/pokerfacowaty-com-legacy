<p id="textbox">There's a good reason I haven't touched neither Street Boyz,
nor San Andreas tonight. The reason's name is Free SO or Free Sims Online.
I've heard something about Sims Online working again, mentioned it yesterday
when in a Discord voicechat on Polish Speedrunners and boom, we spent like
half a night just grinding money. We're already ready to buy a property, build
a house and all that jazz, so I'm pretty hyped for some more. Also since the
game is in the slowest mode of the original Sims, at least it feels like it
(1 in-game minute takes about 5 secs), it's pretty good for doing other stuff
when getting skills or sleeping. Grinding ILs might be a perfect activity to
fit there :P

<p id="textbox">The idea of finishing Life is Strange: Before the Storm the second time 
popped in my head recently and I really feel like doing it. Knowing me it'll be done in a one
long sitting, maybe on stream even.<br><br>Also my yesterday's idea of going rollerblading by the river
kinda worked today. My Hi8 is not charging and only working when plugged,
so I guess I'm looking into buying a new battery (fortunately found an OG
one for a decent price already). But when I do, I'll surely test it out properly
and share the results here. Just skating worked out perfectly though, I ended up
skating for over and hour and doing that before taking a shower and going to sleep
feels awesome. I'm not a sports guy, never have been. But, from the top of my head 
regular skating (or rollerblading, as I usually call it to be precise), ice skating and 
snowboarding are always an exception. Have a good day, speak to you soon! :3</p>
