<p id="textbox">Going to sleep soon, so I won't elaborate too much. Another part of SA's Master Save is already
on YouTube - Taxi Driver and maxed Pilot's Skill took me about 3 hours. Fortunately, the latter didn't need much of
my attention. After I'd done it, I realized it wasn't even on my list, nor was even obtaining a Pilot's License, good stuff. 
Some Master Save goals are streamable, but maxing skills is the exact opposite. I'd rather do it offline
and watch something during it than risk not having anyone in chat. I think I died once on the way (surprisingly during the 
Taxi Driver part), but on the other hand I managed to survive accidentally getting 4 stars when flying and then getting shot 
by a Hydra right as I was landing near the Santa Maria Beach safehouse.

As for the Street Boyz part of my current plans, I played Guren Street for about an hour tonight. The lowest I got were 2 1:27s,
so still 4 seconds to go. Might stream it soon if the idea pops in my mind early in the day. The combination of movement and
constant camera changes on this level is awful, but I'm slowly getting a hang of it.
