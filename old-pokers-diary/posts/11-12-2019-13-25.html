Wow, a month since I last posted here. The reason for that is pretty simple -
my life has taken a different turn and I haven't got much time for running
lately or simply felt like doing other stuff in my free time. Don't get me wrong though -
it's not the classic edition of not running where I really want to play but just can't.
I'm as happy as possible with what's been happening with my life outside of this diary.

Anyway, me writing here probably means something gaming related happened. Got back to playing Street Boyz 
a couple days ago and took a serious approach to get that 1:23 in Guren Street I wanted. Learned to do 
the bossfight quickly and here it is, my very own 1:23. Might go for Guren Street Alternative Route now since 
like half of the IL is pretty much the same and it's in my muscle memory anyway. Click the image if you'd 
like to see the 1:23.

I love how I can actually bear with the constant camera changes on Guren Street now and how awful
it was to do it (or rather not know what the hell to do and fail) at first. I remember someone (probably
pitpo or Kaadzik) watching me play irl early on and being surprised by how I can't manage to walk properly
until they tried it themselves and the camera angles screwed them at well.
