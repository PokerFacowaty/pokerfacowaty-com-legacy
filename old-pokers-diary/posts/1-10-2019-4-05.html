<p id="textbox">Today's highlight was surely going to get another CRT, except it
was supposed to be a monitor this time around. Iiyama, 1600x1200 at 92 Hz (and 160 Hz at 800x600,
take that, modern 144 Hz losers!), fancy stuff. Took quite a while to let alone make it to the
first bus stop with this thing, not evening talking about getting it home. About 30 kgs is really
something. But, as usual, totally
worth it. Windows 10 loses sharpness in some areas of the screen, but that seems like a matter
of proper calibration. Tested it for a couple seconds with Vice City and Mafia, both at 1600x1200
and the effects are incredible.

Had a chance to also test it out with a modern game, since I started playing Life is Strange: Before
the Storm on stream tonight and it plays a stunning role on that field, too. The only issue was the game's
resolution, the temporary fix I used stretched 1600x900 to 1600x1200. It was still in 16:9 on stream and I didn't
mention the stretch too much. I think someone found a way to switch the resolution in the actual game using Cheat
Engine to achieve 21:9 and I assume it actually changes the resolution and not just straight up stretches the picture. Will have
to test it out.
 Played for a couple of hours, finished the first episode. Took a shower now
and finally heading to sleep. 
<br><br>I'm supposed to offically start uni tomorrow and meet with people from my group
right afterwards. Glad it's going to be at like 2PM, since this cannot mean a-lot-of-drinking-with-loud-music-in-some-club
type of meeting. Or at least I hope so, lol. Good night.
