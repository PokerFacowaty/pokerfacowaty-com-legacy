<p id="textbox">I'm alive. And well. Just haven't been playing much stuff and that's
what this diary was supposed to be about. Focusing on uni and irl a bit more, studying
things I actually enjoy is pretty damn good and meeting all the people seems fun so far.<br><br>
Speedrunning-wise, I got back to Wave Race 64, finally tried running Normal on NTSC on my Wii.
Ended up with a 10:01 now, will probably try to go lower soon. Or not. 
Also got back to Gothic All Chapters since I might submit it to ESA Winter 2019.
Have a pic of my PB and I'll see you soon. Be sure to watch GTAMarathon this weekend ;)
