I haven't been here for a while, so I'll keep it short with more
recent news.
<br><br>
I've got a couple new speedgames. Hotline Miami
is pretty exciting, as it requires a lot of skill and
a pretty good warm up every time we touch I get this feeling and
everytime we kiss I swear I can fly. I've also tried running a game
I vaguely remembered from my childhood - Sammy Suricate in Lion Land.
Turned out it made me and some other people from the Polish community
actively look for skips in it for about three days. We've managed to
find skips (as in, "ignore the level, go to the end" skips) for almost
all of the 36 levels in the game. I kept finding new ones afterwards and now
the game is REALLY broken. I also wanted some simple short JRPG or something
similar to run while watching something or during e-classes. Turned out
Pokemon Blue with a route from 2015 (so no manips) was pretty much perfect.
Got a 19:08 and wanted to stop there, submit it and move to probably learning
manips, but I didn't record a hard reset, so my PB is invalid, which puts me in a pretty weird state.
No idea if I should go for sub 19 or learn manips, we'll see, I guess, not that it's
the only game I do recently.

As of recent speedrunning events, ESA Winter was awesome as always. GSPS Dzieciom 2020
raised a record-breaking 10111 PLN (about $2410) and turned out to be amazing as well.
Already writing down ideas for GSPS 2020.
