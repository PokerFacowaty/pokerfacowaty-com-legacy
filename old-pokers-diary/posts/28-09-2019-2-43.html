(Poker from 15 minutes later here: Ooops :D)
Mary came to spend the weekend at our place, so did pitpo and that resulted
in a little party. We revived one of the PS1s I'd bought recently so that it
actually reads CDs properly. A silver PS2 was revived from the dead (the on/off
switch was missing, classic), but then I MAY have connected the wrong wires on the
switch to turn it on and it died again. Doesn't really matter, since I didn't expect
it to work at all. Still cool having a silver model just for its case. With Mary's
power adaptor, I was able to check out my 2 fat X360s. Falcon (next to last motherboard's
revision in fat X360s) had been said to have RRoD (Red Ring of Death) and it really did. 
Got it for 5 z≈Ç (about $1.25) with other stuff, so not like I was expecting much. BUT. 
The Xenon (first revision, aprrox. 50% of them were said to have RRoD) one seems to be 
working properly. And that's pretty special since I've always kinda wanted a Xenon without
RRoD to have it and never turn it on so it stays that way. Now I just have to start it up
from a fridge whenever I wanna boast about it, ezpz.

After such an incredible amount of success, Mary and Kaadzik went to play some Wii anime surgeon sumilator
that I forgot the name of, but speedruns of it are supposed to be pretty cool. Pitpo digged into
my records and we talked about music for a bit.

Tomorrow we're going to an electronics market I discovered here. No idea what to expect,
but we'll have a car, so I might bring something big with me again. THEN we're going to
have a roadtrip to MAX since we realized they have restaurants in Poland and one of them
is like 100 kms away. Pitpo got to know I have yet to listen to "Dark Side of the Moon"
for the first time and I'm supposed to do so during the trip. Might be interesting.
