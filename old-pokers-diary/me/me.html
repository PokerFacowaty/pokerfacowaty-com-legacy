<h1>About Me</h1>
<p id="textbox"> I'm PokerFacowaty or Bartek. I'm 20 years old and my main interests are speedrunning and retrogaming. 
I like writing stuff about myself at times. This professionally designed website is, as the name suggests,
a diary. It's 'public' to maybe give me some motivation to keep writing.</p> <br>
<p id="textbox">My story with speedrunning starts on Christmas 2016. I was visiting friends in Dubai with my family and
was bored as hell (still think the city lacks any charm). Thought I might try and run Super Mario Bros.
on my PSP with just practice and not watching any tutorials. That turned out to be a pretty good time
killer. After I got back home, I went on to check some of my favourite games on speedrun.com, namely 
GTA: Vice City (a pole, ZEKORI_ had an All Missions WR at the time!) and Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven.</p> <br>
<p id="textbox">Mafia had a really well-made (though obsolete now) tutorial by Lembox and that motivated me to try it.
After some practice, silly me figured my run would take about 4 hours (WR was a 3:03 by Lembox at the time).
Oh well. On Sunday, 21st March 2017, I started my run at 7 PM thinking it'd end around 11. A 5:53:08 was not 
really what I expected. But it was a start. A start of a wonderful adventure defining who and where I am now.
And I couldn't be happier.</p>
